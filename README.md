### Games

**Slots:**
You press one of the four buttons to place your bet amount, then you press the **Spin** button to spin the wheel.
Get two of a kind or three of a kind matching pairs to win. No matching pairs means you lose.

**War:**
Put in the amount of **MAAD** Coins you want to bet into the text box, then press **PLAY WAR**. Having a higher hand
than the dealer wins you that round. Having a smaller hand loses you that round. A tie means you neither
lose nor win Coins.

**Roulette:**
Choose what you would like to bet on (Red, Black, Even, Odd, or a number) and place you bet. Press the Play button and
wait for the result. Depending on whether you win or lose your payout will concur with the result. A correct guess of
the 50/50 bets (Even-Odd and Red-Black) will pay 1:1 and a correct number guess will pay 35:1.

**Blackjack:**
Based on skill and luck, you have to beat the Dealer without going over 21. Input your bet amount, and start a new round.
Each round, the Player and the Dealer each get two cards. However, the Dealer's second card is hidden until after you stand.
Press the **Hit** button to draw another card. You want to have a higher hand than the Dealer, but be careful on not 
going over 21. Press the **Stand** button to finish your turn. After you stand, the Dealer will go next, revealing his 
second card. The Dealer has to keep drawing cards if his deck is under 17. Once the Dealer goes 17 or beyond, the round ends.
