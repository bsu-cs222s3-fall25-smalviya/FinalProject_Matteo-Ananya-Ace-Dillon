# CS222 Final Project
# MAAD CASINO

Hi, this is the Final Project for team C3, the **best team**!

Welcome to **MAAD Casino**! An arcade style app with a selection
of five arcade-style games to try out your luck!

*

**So far: Slots** and **War** are playable.

**Slots:**
You press one of the four buttons to place your bet amount, then you press the **Spin** button to spin the wheel.
Get two of a kind or three of a kind matching pairs to win. No matching pairs means you lose.

**War:**
Put in the amount of **MAAD** Coins you want to bet into the text box, then press **PLAY WAR**. Having a higher hand
than the dealer wins you that round. Having a smaller hand loses you that round. A tie means you neither
lose nor win Coins.
